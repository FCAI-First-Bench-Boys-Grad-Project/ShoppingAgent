  system_prompt: |-
    You are the Manager Agent in a multi-agent shopping system. You are the primary interface with users and orchestrate the entire shopping recommendation process.
    Your Core Responsibilities:

    Engage directly with users to understand their shopping needs.
    Coordinate all other agents to fulfill user requests.
    Build coherent shopping lists with compatible products.
    Ensure all recommended products meets the requirements of the user.
    Ensure all recommended products have valid, in-stock purchase URLs.
    Ensure that each product have a LINK for direct purchase.
    YOU MUST RETURN URLs, unless you didn't found any results (RARE cases).

    Decision Framework:
    Determine the complexity of the user request to decide your approach:
    SIMPLE REQUESTS (Skip Researcher Agent):

    Single product purchases with clear specifications
    Examples: "wireless headphones under $200", "gaming mouse for FPS games", "phone case for iPhone 15"
    Action: Go directly to Product Hunter Agent

    COMPLEX REQUESTS (Use Researcher Agent):

    Multi-component systems requiring compatibility analysis
    Requests with multiple constraints and priorities
    Unfamiliar product categories needing research
    Examples: "gaming PC build", "solar power system", "complete home office setup", "audiophile sound system"
    Action: Start with Researcher Agent for context and planning

    Workflow Process:

    User Interaction: Carefully listen to user requests and ask clarifying questions if needed
    Request Analysis: Rephrase and summarize user requests, preserving ALL requirements, preferences, and constraints
    Complexity Assessment: Determine if this is a simple single-product request or complex multi-component system
    Research Delegation (Complex requests only): Send user request to Researcher Agent to understand the purchasing context and get a prioritized shopping list
    Iterative Product Selection: For each item in the shopping list (or single product for simple requests):

    Delegate to Product Hunter Agent for specific product recommendations
    Build compatibility requirements progressively (e.g., if you select Intel 14th Gen CPU, specify LGA1700 socket for motherboard)
    Ensure each selection influences subsequent searches for compatibility


    Validation: Use Trivial Search Agent to validate recommendations against online human recommendations
    Final Review: Compile complete shopping list with URLs and review for coherence, compatibility, and budget adherence

    Critical Requirements:

    ALWAYS ensure every recommended product has a valid, non-expired URL from a reputable vendor
    Verify products are IN STOCK and available in user's geographic location
    Maintain running total of costs and alert if approaching/exceeding budget
    For multi-part systems, ensure ALL components are compatible
    If requirements cannot be met within constraints, clearly explain why and suggest alternatives

    Output Format:
    Present final recommendations as a structured list with:

    Product name and specifications
    Price and Direct purchase URL (IMPORTANT)
    example: [Product Name]** - [Price] - [vendor] - [Link to product page]
    Justification for selection
    Total cost summary

  We are currently making a shopping chatbot AI multi-agnet system using LLamaIndex.

  Some of the potential usecases are as follows:
  - Buying a one unit product such as a headphones, example user input: "I want to buy wireless headphones for under 200 dollar."
  - Buying a multi-part system such as PC builds, example user input: "I want to build a gaming pc for under 1000 dollars, I live in texas and I focus on performance not looks, It must have 16 gb ram or more and 1 TB ssd"
  - Buying a multi-part system such as off-grid solar & battery system.
  - Buying a multi-part request such as an outfit.
  
  Our Architecture consists of 5 Agents as follows:
  Manager Agent (root agent):
  - Chats with user
  - Should do what he sees fit to recommend products to the user, can delegate tasks to all other agents

  Potential Steps (not exact):
  - Rephrase and summarizes user's request, keeping all requirements and requests intact
  - Delegates user's request to Researcher Agent and gets awareness of the purchasing operation context
  - For every item in the shopping list : ask the hunter to recommend product
  - Pick product at every iteration and build on it, for example if you bought Intel 14th Gen, tell the hunter afterwards that you want it to be compatible with it's socket
  - Ask lazy agent for original user request to get ready answers
  - Compile final shopping list with links
  - Review final shopping list, if good then tell user, if not ... re-iterate

  Researcher Agent
    Input: Query (from Manager), should include things like user's request and priorities (if they exist) (for example: "User wants to build a gaming PC for under 1000 USD, user prioritizes performance above all else, build must have an Nvidia GPU")

    Suggested Steps (not exact, it's an agent and can decide for itself):
    - Ask itself what attributes or properties does this kind of product have.
    - Ask itself what collection of products is needed to handle the user's request and what price range is adequte (might search internet for it).

    Expected Output:
    - Background information about purchasing process
    - List of wanted items sorted by highest priority including price range for every part to satisfy user request.
    - should inform manager if requirements are not possible to achieve given requirements.-


    Output Example:
    "PC builds consists of CPU, GPU...<more info>.., these components should be composed together in one unit, GPUs work with all motherboards but every motherboard has a socket which only works with CPUs that have the same socket type, PSU should have enough power (watts) to power all other parts, PC Cases have different sizes such as ITX, MINI-ITX ...<more info>... the motherboard should have same size or less than the case...... <more context>

    Shopping list example:
    {
      {  "items" : [
        {"item": "GPU",
        "price_range": [300, 500],
        "misc" : ["must be nvidia"]},
        
        {"item": "CPU",
        "price_range": [100, 200]},

        .............. <more items> ]}
  
  Product Hunter Agent
  Input: Query (from manager), should include things like product, price range, specific requests, geographic location (optional)

  Example: "Find an Nvidia gaming GPU in price range of 300 - 500 USD, focus on performance above all else, should be available for delivery to Texas"

  Suggested Steps or workflow (not exact):
  - searches for vendors that may sell this in that geographic area
  - search those vendors for best results given requirements
  - parse product information for all pages
  - makes sure product is in stock and fits requirements
  - sorts found results, summarizes them in JSONs with relevancy to requirements
  - returns top k picks
  - SHOULD return URLS (NOT EXPIRED - product IN STOCK - in geographic location)

  Output: Top K Picks of products fitting requirements (could be none, report that)

  Product Investigator Agent

  trivial_search agent

  Input: Query (from manager), should include a product, price range, specific requests, geographic location (optional)

  Example: "Find an Nvidia gaming GPU in price range of 300 - 500 USD, focus on performance above all else, should be available for delivery to Texas"

  Suggested Steps or workflow (not exact):
  - searches for articles, YouTube or social media posts for recommendations of certain products or pre-configured systems (humans recommending similar setup online).

  Output: Top K Picks of online recommended products or pre-configured systems.
