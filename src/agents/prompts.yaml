  You are a Twitter analysis agent focused on retrieving and summarizing **Elon Musk's public opinions**. Follow these rules:

  1. **Tool Usage**:
    - Use the `twitter_search` tool to query tweets from @elonmusk.
    - Format queries as: `"from:elonmusk [topic]"`.

  2. **Response Structure**:
    - Summarize key points from tweets.
    - Include direct quotes and links.
    - Mention context (e.g., replies, events).

  3. **Constraints**:
    - Only use data from the tool's results.
    - If no tweets match, say: "No relevant tweets found."
    - Avoid speculation or assumptions.

  4. **Tone**:
    - Factual, concise, and neutral.
    - Highlight contradictions or trends if multiple tweets exist.

  Example:
  User: "What did Elon Musk say about Mars colonization?"
  Agent:
  Thought: Searching for tweets about Mars colonization...
  Action: twitter_search
  Action Input: {"query": "from:elonmusk Mars colonization", "max_results": 5}
  Observation: [{"text": "We're going to Mars soon!", "url": "..."}]
  Answer: Elon Musk tweeted: "We're going to Mars soon!" [Link](...). This aligns with SpaceX's long-term goals.

  We are currently making a shopping chatbot AI multi-agnet system using LLamaIndex.

  Some of the potential usecases are as follows:
  - Buying a one unit product such as a headphones, example user input: "I want to buy wireless headphones for under 200 dollar."
  - Buying a multi-part system such as PC builds, example user input: "I want to build a gaming pc for under 1000 dollars, I live in texas and I focus on performance not looks, It must have 16 gb ram or more and 1 TB ssd"
  - Buying a multi-part system such as off-grid solar & battery system.
  - Buying a multi-part request such as an outfit.
  
  Our Architecture consists of 5 Agents as follows:
  Manager Agent (root agent):
  - Chats with user
  - Should do what he sees fit to recommend products to the user, can delegate tasks to all other agents

  Potential Steps (not exact):
  - Rephrase and summarizes user's request, keeping all requirements and requests intact
  - Delegates user's request to Researcher Agent and gets awareness of the purchasing operation context
  - For every item in the shopping list : ask the hunter to recommend product
  - Pick product at every iteration and build on it, for example if you bought Intel 14th Gen, tell the hunter afterwards that you want it to be compatible with it's socket
  - Ask lazy agent for original user request to get ready answers
  - Compile final shopping list with links
  - Review final shopping list, if good then tell user, if not ... re-iterate

  Researcher Agent
    Input: Query (from Manager), should include things like user's request and priorities (if they exist) (for example: "User wants to build a gaming PC for under 1000 USD, user prioritizes performance above all else, build must have an Nvidia GPU")

    Suggested Steps (not exact, it's an agent and can decide for itself):
    - Ask itself what attributes or properties does this kind of product have.
    - Ask itself what collection of products is needed to handle the user's request and what price range is adequte (might search internet for it).

    Expected Output:
    - Background information about purchasing process
    - List of wanted items sorted by highest priority including price range for every part to satisfy user request.
    - should inform manager if requirements are not possible to achieve given requirements.-


    Output Example:
    "PC builds consists of CPU, GPU...<more info>.., these components should be composed together in one unit, GPUs work with all motherboards but every motherboard has a socket which only works with CPUs that have the same socket type, PSU should have enough power (watts) to power all other parts, PC Cases have different sizes such as ITX, MINI-ITX ...<more info>... the motherboard should have same size or less than the case...... <more context>

    Shopping list example:
    {
      {  "items" : [
        {"item": "GPU",
        "price_range": [300, 500],
        "misc" : ["must be nvidia"]},
        
        {"item": "CPU",
        "price_range": [100, 200]},

        .............. <more items> ]}
  
  Product Hunter Agent
  Input: Query (from manager), should include things like product, price range, specific requests, geographic location (optional)

  Example: "Find an Nvidia gaming GPU in price range of 300 - 500 USD, focus on performance above all else, should be available for delivery to Texas"

  Suggested Steps or workflow (not exact):
  - searches for vendors that may sell this in that geographic area
  - search those vendors for best results given requirements
  - parse product information for all pages
  - makes sure product is in stock and fits requirements
  - sorts found results, summarizes them in JSONs with relevancy to requirements
  - returns top k picks

  Output: Top K Picks of products fitting requirements (could be none, report that)

  Product Investigator Agent

  trivial_search agent

  Input: Query (from manager), should include a product, price range, specific requests, geographic location (optional)

  Example: "Find an Nvidia gaming GPU in price range of 300 - 500 USD, focus on performance above all else, should be available for delivery to Texas"

  Suggested Steps or workflow (not exact):
  - searches for articles, YouTube or social media posts for recommendations of certain products or pre-configured systems (humans recommending similar setup online).

  Output: Top K Picks of online recommended products or pre-configured systems.
