But the info is minimal. I need to figure out what else to ask. The previous message listed some clarifications needed: budget, features, screen size, storage.\n\nFirst, I should probably search for current iPhone models to know what options are available. That way, I can frame my questions better. Let me use the search tool with "iOS phones 2023" or something similar. Wait, the user might be looking for the latest models, so maybe "iPhone models 2023" is better. Let me check that.\n\nOnce I have the latest models, I can then ask about budget ranges. For example, if the latest iPhone is around $1000, I can ask if they want something under or over that. Also, features like camera specs, battery life, and storage options vary between models. So knowing the current lineup will help me structure the follow-up questions.\n\nI should also consider if there are any new features in the latest iOS versions that might influence their decision. But maybe that\'s getting too detailed. The main goal is to get enough info to recommend a few models and then narrow down based on their preferences.\n\nWait, the user might not know the exact models, so providing some options based on their budget and needs would be helpful. So first, I need to gather data on current iPhones, their prices, features, etc. Then, I can ask the user to specify their budget and priorities.\n'), matched_stop=None)], created=1750970667, model='qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=355, prompt_tokens=2204, total_tokens=2559, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None))
