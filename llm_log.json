The user wants an Android phone with the best camera quality. From the previous tool calls, I found some Samsung Galaxy S24 models on Amazon and Samsung\'s official site. The extracted info includes prices, specs like the 200MP camera on the S24 Ultra, and features like Nightography and Generative Edit. But wait, are there other top contenders besides Samsung? The initial search had Google Pixel 9 Pro mentioned in TechRadar, but the MintMobile link didn\'t have extractable product details. Maybe I should check Google Store for Pixel 9 Pro as well.\n\nAlso, the Amazon results for Samsung S24 Ultra show two variants: 256GB at $1299.99 and 512GB at $1099. Wait, that seems like a price error. Usually, higher storage costs more. Maybe it\'s a typo or a special offer. Need to confirm that. Additionally, the DxOMark top-rated smartphones weren\'t explored yet. Should I check DxOMark\'s latest rankings to ensure these Samsung models are indeed top in camera quality.\n\nI have three Samsung models: S24 Ultra, S24+, and S24. The Ultra has the best specs with 200MP and 100x zoom. But are there other brands like Google Pixel or OnePlus that might offer better cameras? The user didn\'t specify brand preference, just Android. So maybe I should search for Google Pixel 9 Pro on Amazon or the Google Store. Also, check if there are any Xiaomi or Sony models with high-end cameras. However, time and tool call limits might restrict that. Since I already have the S24 Ultra and S24 with good specs and prices, maybe that\'s sufficient. But to be thorough, a quick search for "Google Pixel 9 Pro camera specs" could help. If the Pixel 9 Pro has better DxOMark scores, I should include it. Otherwise, stick with Samsung. Also, check if the Amazon links are actual product pages where the user can purchase. The S24 Ultra links are Amazon product pages, so those are valid. The Samsung site links are more about specs, not direct purchases. So focus on Amazon for purchase links. \n\nI think I have enough products now. The S24 Ultra and S24 are solid options with detailed specs and prices. If the user wants more options, maybe include the Pixel 9 Pro, but without the product link, it\'s hard. So proceed with the Samsung models and mention the price discrepancy as a note.
